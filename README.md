(Internal integrated control chipTM1908)

   This 5050RGB is a dedicated circuit IC with a single-line three-channel LED constant current driver. It is
packaged in a wick, and integrated with MCU single-line digital interface, data latch, LED constant current
drive, PWM brightness control, gamma correction and other circuits. Can be cascaded through dual-channel
input and output digital interfaces, and the external controller can control the chip with a single wire. Spare
communication port, realizes that a chip in the cascade is damaged without affecting the normal use of the
subsequent stage. The constant current value and PWM brightness value output by each OUT drive port can
be set individually through commands. This product has excellent performance and reliable quality.
